# Loss Functions

This repository includes implementations of three commonly used loss functions in machine learning: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy, and Binary Cross-Entropy.

## Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Squared Error is a widely used loss function for regression problems. It measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

### Formula:

\[ \text{MSE}(\text{actual}, \text{predict}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\text{actual}_i - \text{predict}_i)^2 \]
