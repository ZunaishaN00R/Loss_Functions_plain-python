# Loss Functions

# Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Squared Error is a widely used loss function for regression problems. It quantifies the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. The larger the MSE, the greater the difference between predicted and actual values.

# Sparse Categorical Cross Entropy
Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy is a loss function commonly used in multi-class classification problems where the labels are provided as integers. It measures the dissimilarity between the true class distribution and the predicted class probabilities. A lower value indicates better alignment between predicted and actual classes.

# Binary Cross Entropy
Binary Cross-Entropy is a loss function commonly used in binary classification problems. It measures the dissimilarity between the true binary distribution and the predicted binary distribution. It is particularly suitable for problems with two classes. A lower value signifies better alignment between predicted and actual binary outcomes.
